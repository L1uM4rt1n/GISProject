    "text": "This is the 10 minutes catchment area for Founders' Memorial Station. The area consists of only a few low-rise buildings as the place around it is a memorial. The purpose of the MRT station serves to benefit tourists the most, who wish to visit the Founders' Memorial as there are no other stations within or near the catchment area. This provides a greater convenience for tourists and locals who want to travel by public transport to the attraction site. \nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area for Founders' Memorial Station. As compared to the 10 minutes catchment area, it has only slightly more low-rise buildings, and the catchment area is slightly bigger. Likewise, there are no other stations that are within or near the catchment area. One reason could be because of the expressway which makes walking from the other stations less accessible. Thus, implementing the Founders' Memorial MRT station will be effective in making the site more accessible to the public and tourists.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of Tanjong Rhu station. The area consists of a few low-rise buildings and does not have any other stations within the catchment area. However, the Circle Line MRT station, Stadium, can be seen on the map to be quite near to the catchment area. However, Stadium station is built to serve commuters who are going to the National Stadium. For the residents living across the National Stadium, they now have access to an MRT station themselves, which brings them to the city without needing to walk across the river to access an MRT station. Thus, it greatly enhances residents living in the vicinity.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Tanjong Rhu station. The area covers a bigger area and encompasses a few larger low-rise buildings. However, in the catchment area captures Stadium station, as mentioned in the 10 minutes catchment area. This is more beneficial for people who want to travel to the National Stadium and are not currently in the Circle Line. This increases the accessibility and ease of travel as people can choose between either the Circle Line or the Thomson-East Coast Line to access the National Stadium for its events or just a weekend getaway with friends or family members. Hence, it is definitely worthwhile to invest in an MRT station at Tanjong Rhu station's location.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of Katong Park Station. From the Map, we can see that the catchment area consists of several low-rise buildings and residential area which consists of apartments and residential buildings. Furthermore, it covers the Eastern end of the East-Coast Park, which will lead users to the nearby Marina Bay vicinity either by walking, jogging, or cycling. With the construction of this station, it brings about higher accessibility for residents staying near the coast to travel towards the city while increasing the accessibility of going to the Marina Bay area for people who are exercising.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Katong Park station. As compared to the 10 minutes catchment area, it spreads out further and consists of more low-rise buildings and residential area in its neighborhood. It shows a greater connectivity to the Marina Bay area leading out from the East-Coast Park exit. While it does provide a greater convenience for people exercising, they are also not short of MRT options to travel back home or elsewhere This MRT station is a 15 minutes' walk away from Mountbatten Station in the Circle Line. While the vicinity has many MRT stations, each station serves a unique purpose, where Katong Park station serves as a stop for users who are in the near the Eastern end of the East-Coast Park. Thus, it will be effective to have a station built there.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of Tanjong Katong Station. It has a considerable number of low-rise buildings and residential area and a few commercial buildings in the area. Most of the low-rise buildings are landed properties. It is uncommon in Singapore to find an area with a high density of landed properties to have an MRT station in the same vicinity. However, with more people advocating for green and sustainable living habits, it may encourage those living in the landed properties to take public transport and not private cars if the MRT station was within a short walking distance of 10 minutes away from their home.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Tanjong Katong Station. As compared to the 10 minutes catchment area, it spreads out slightly more, having slightly more low-rise buildings and residential area. As compared to the rest of the stations thus far, this station does not consist of another MRT station(s) within a 15 minutes catchment area. Thus, this increases the effectiveness of the catchment area, as it becomes even more accessible for the people in the area to take public transport.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area for Marine Parade Station. This MRT station covers the most retail buildings in the area. The most prominent shopping mall in the area is Parkway Parade. Currently, commuters who wish to visit the shopping mall will either take a bus from the nearest MRT station, Dakota MRT station, or take a shuttle bus from either Sengkang, Tampines, or Bedok. However, shuttle bus services are only available during the weekends, making it highly inaccessible for commuters who are not living within the vicinity to visit the shopping mall. It also covers a church, Touch Centre. Thus, having an MRT station built in this vicinity will greatly enhance the accessibility of accessing the retail shops, especially Parkway Parade shopping mall and the church for commuters who are not living in the vicinity.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Marine Parade Station. It covers a more extensive area of the buildings covered by the 10 minutes catchment area. On top of that, it also covers a large portion along the stretch of the East Coast Park. Currently, park goers either drive-in or take a bus to the nearest stop to go to East Coast Park. If this station was build, it will greatly enhance the seaside for park goers. However, it is also worthwhile to note that this station is also a 15 minutes' walk away from Tanjong Katong Station in its East and Marine Terrace Station in its West. While the advantages of having an MRT station build in this vicinity is obvious, there will be doubters who want to shed a bad light on having MRT stations in such close proximity. Nevertheless, our group feels that this MRT station not only helps to increase accessibility for residents living in this area to access other parts of Singapore, but also helps to bring commuters from other areas who wish to access the shopping malls, churches, or the East-Coast Park to this vicinity. Hence, it is definitely a cost-effective station to have.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of Marine Terrace Station. This is the MRT Station that covers the most schools amongst all MRT Stations in the same area. With Tao Nan School, St Patrick's School, CHIJ Katong Convent, and Victoria Junior College all within a 10 minutes' walk away from the MRT station, it is highly accessible for these education institutions and brings about more convenience for students in these school than before.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Marine Terrace Station. From the polygon that we have mapped out, it is important to note that there is an overlap, where it is possible to reach Marine Parade Station within 15 minutes' walk from Marine Terrace Station. While some may argue that it decreases the effectiveness of having 2 stations in such close proximity to one another, it is important to note that it is highly beneficial for the schools on the East of the Marine Terrace Station, such as Victoria Junior Collect and St Patrick's School. Without this station, they will have to travel 30 minutes to reach the next closest MRT station, hence while Marine Terrace and Marine Parade stations are in close proximity, both serve an important purpose in providing convenience for specific users in the vicinity.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of Siglap Station. There are many low-rise buildings, apartments, and residential buildings in the area. It also includes a mosque, Masjid Kampung Siglap, as well as a school, Victoria School. It will bring about more convenience not just to the residents living in the vicinity, but also the Muslim community who wishes to take the public transport after their prayers, and the students from Victoria School who wishes to go home after a day in school.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Siglap Station. Similar to the 10 minutes catchment area, it covers a myriad of amenities as well as residential buildings nearby. The 15 minutes catchment area is even more extensive, and it further shows the importance of having Siglap Station in the vicinity as it will greatly improve the convenience of travel for people in the same area. There is also no other MRT stations within a 15 minutes' walk away, thus making it one of the most ideal spots to build an MRT station.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the 10 minutes catchment area of the Bayshore Station. There are many low-rise buildings, apartments, and residential buildings in the area. Most of the low-rise buildings are landed properties similar to the Tanjong Katong Station. With the station within a short walking distance of 10 minutes away from their home, it certainly incentivise those living in the landed properties to take public transport and not private cars.\n\nThis is the 15 minutes catchment area of Bayshore Station. Similar to the 10 minutes catchment area, it consists of a large proportion of low-rise buildings, apartments, and residential area. In addition to that, Temasek Secondary School is also within the vicinity of a 15 minutes' walk. Hence, our group concluded that it is highly beneficial for an MRT station to be built here to increase the accessibility of public transport for both the residents living in this area as well as the students from Temasek Secondary School. Furthermore, there is no other MRT stations in the nearby vicinity, making it an important infrastructure to have in this area in the near future."

Data was downloaded as a whole but only the Singapore roads and buildings layer were kept.\nhttps://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/Geospatial/TrainStation.zip Data points of the MRT stations.\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv Using coordinates found from Google Maps, we created a CSV file for the Stage 4 MRT stations with their individual latitude and longitude points.\n\n\n\nAdding of Datasets\n\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations\n\nFirst go to ‘Add Layer’, then ‘Add Delimited Text Layer’.\n\nSelect the TE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv CSV file. Under the X and Y field, select Longitude and Latitude respectively. Leave Geometry CRS as WGS 84.\n\nThe following points should appear as below.\n\nSave the layer as GeoPackage and name the layer Stage4_TE_Line, and the CRS as EPSG:3414 – SVY21.\n\n\nMP19 Subzone Layer\n\nAdd in the MP19 Subzone kml layer.\n\n\nOSM layer\n\nAdd the OSM road layer in. Use ‘Select by polygon’ and select the area outlined by the MP19 Subzone layer, leaving out some of the SOuthern Islands, Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong.\n\nExport and Save Selected Features as GeoPackage. Name the layer as all_roads.\n\nRepeat the steps for OSM buildings layer and name it as all_buildings.\nRemove the OSM buildigns and roads layer.\n\nOther MRT lines\n\nAdd the MRTLRTStnPtt.shp file into the layers. There are many different lines but the ones closest to the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line are Circle Line, Downtown Line, and the East-West Line.\nOpen the attribute table of the shape file and click ‘Select by Expression’.\n\nSelect by STN_NO with the letter ‘CC’ in it.\n\nSave the selected features and name the layer Circle Line.\nDo the same for the Downtown and East-West Line, replacing the ‘CC%’ with ‘DT%’ and ‘EW%’ and name the layers Downtown Line and East-West Line respectively.\n\nCleaning Road Data\n\nThere are expressways where the people are not able to walk on. Thus, we have to filter out the following roads with these fclass: motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link.\nSelect all_roads layer and open attribute table, click on select by expression.\nSelect the roads with fclass: ‘motorway’, ‘motorway_link’, ‘trunk’, ‘trunk_link’.\n\nSelect ‘Invert Selection’ to select all the roads without the ones needed to be filtered away. Export and save selected features in GeoPackage and name the layer as walking_roads.\n\nCleaning Buildings Data\n\nThe all_buildings layer consists of several null values under the “type” column. After looking at Google Maps, there consists of different types of low-rise buildings, shophouses, etc. Thus, the team decided to replace the null values for “type” column with low-rise buildings.\nRight-click on all_buildings layer and select Open Attribute Table. Click on Select by Expression. Type in “type” is null in the expression box. Click on Select Features. This will select all building types that have null values.\n\nAfter selecting features, Open field calculator and update the values to ‘low-rise buildings’.\n\nClick on the pencil icon to save the edits.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Buffers and Iso-Area Polygons\nObjective: Creation of Buffer and Iso-Areas with these data\n\nCreating a 15min Buffer Area\n\nSelect the first station of Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line (Founders’ Memorial).\nGo to Vector –> Select Geoprocessing Tools –> Buffer.\nCheck ‘Selected Features only’\nDistance – 0.75 miles (average walking distance of 15min)\nSegments – 100\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nSave the temporary layer ‘Buffer’ that was generated to GeoPackage, with the layer name as TE22A 15mins Walking Radius.\n\nCreating a 10min Buffer Area\n\nUsing the same steps, the only difference is changing the distance to 0.5miles (average walking distance of 10mins).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nCreating a 15min Iso-Area as Polygon\n\nUsing a plugin, QNEAT3, under Iso-Areas, select Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\nUnder Vector layer, select walking_roads layer.\nUnder Start Points, select Stage4_TE_line, check selected features only Change Unique point ID Field to STN_NAME.\nUnder Size of Iso-Area and Contour Interval, input 900 (15 mins = 900 seconds).\nChange path type to calculate to Fastest Path (time optimisation).\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nSave the polygon layer into the GeoPackage, naming the layer and remove the interpolation layer.\n\nCreating a 10min Iso-Area as Polygon\n\nUsing the same steps, the only changes that needs to be made is:\nUnder Size of Iso-Area and Contour Interval, input 600 (10 mins = 600 seconds).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nCatchment area Buildings – We will be looking at what buildings are there in the catchment area.\n\nFor 15min Catchment Area, select Clip under Geoprocessing Tools.\n\nUnder Input Layer, select all_buildings layer\nUnder Overlay layer, select TE22A 15mins Catchment Area layer\n\nIf done correctly, the following temporary ‘Clipped’ should appear and look like this:\n\nSave the ‘Clipped’ temporary layer as TE22A 15mins Buildings to the GeoPackage.\nFor 10min Catchment Area, repeat the same steps but replacing the Overlay layer with TE22A 10mins Catchment Area, and save to GeoPackage as TE22A 10mins Buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown: (With the 10mins layer active only)\n\n\nRepeat the Steps for Buffer, Iso-Area Polygon and Catchment area buildings for the rest of the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line.\n\n\n\nCreating Symbols and /or Area Colour\n\nFor point Data (Symbols)\n\nWe will need to use symbols to represent the various point layers for easier visualisation.\nFirstly, we will save each station individually into the GeoPackage.\nUsing TE22A station, select the feature and Save Selected Feature as GeoPackage. Name the layer Founders’ Memorial MRT.\nRight Click on Layer –> click on Properties. A pop up ‘Layer Properties’ will appear.\nClick on Symbology –> Simple Marker –> Change the Symbol layer type to SVG Marker –> Search for ‘train’ at the search bar under SVG images –> double-click on the icon\n\nRepeat the steps above for the other Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line stations.\nFor Circle Line, Downtown Line and East-West Line, without the need to save each station individually, repeat the above steps but with the following colours:\nCircle Line – #ffbf00\nDowntown Line – #0009be\nEast-West Line – #00d644\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor Buffer Layer\n\nWe will be using a standardised colour across all 10min and 15min Buffer Layers. In addition, the transparency will be lower for clearer visibility of the catchment area.\nUsing TE22A 15mins Walking Radius, right click on select Properties. Click on Symbology –> Change fill colour to #000080 –> Change Opacity to 30% –> Save Symbol and name it as a Buffer layer –> it should appear in Project Styles for east access.\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nRepeat the steps for all 10min and 15min Walking Radius (Use the Saved Symbol in Project styles for easy access).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor Iso-Area Polygon\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins Catchment Area, right click and select Properties –> Click on Symbology –> Change fill colour to #ffdf53 –> Change Opacity to 70% –> Save Symbol and name it as Iso-Area layer –> it should appear in Project Styles for easy access.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nRepeat the steps while using the Iso-Area in Project styles for the rest of the 10mins and 15mins Catchment Area.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor the buildings in Catchment Area\n\nWe will categorise the buildings based on its attribute ‘type’. We will also be standardising each colour for each type based on the following colours:\n\n\n\nBuilding Type\nColour Code\n\n\n\n\napartments\n#477bce\n\n\nchurch\n#e1de21\n\n\ncommercial\n#beb956\n\n\nconstruction\n#45e1c4\n\n\ngarage\n#6c6c6c\n\n\nhouse\n#9cf046\n\n\nkindergarten\n#a27a50\n\n\nlow-rise building\n#0101ff\n\n\nmosque\n#55b987\n\n\npublic\n#42ce81\n\n\nresidential\n#4a2b84\n\n\nroof\n#ea58ca\n\n\nschool\n#ff3355\n\n\ntemple\n#c3154c\n\n\nterrace\n#6c8341\n\n\nretail\n#9200f4\n\n\nhut\n#501dcf\n\n\noffice\n#ff85ed\n\n\nEiS-Residences\n#01f7ff\n\n\nservice\n#d44f3b\n\n\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins Building Layer, Right Click and Select Properties –> Select Symbology –> save the symbols for the type of buildings. Below is an example for apartments:\n\n****** Blur IMAGE ******\nDo the same for the other categories of buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should show in your Project Styles:\n\nWith the saved symbols, now select categorised symbols in the drop-down box at the top –> Under Value, select ‘type’ –> Click Classify –> Change the colours according to the saved symbols –> remove all other values.\n\nRepeat the steps for all the stations’ catchment area buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should show:\n\n\nThickness of roads\n\nFor ease of visibility, we will decrease the walking_roads layer thickness to 0.2mm and change the colour to black.\n\n\n\n\n\nPiecing the layers together\n\nAfter we have completed the standardisation and changing of the symbology and colours, we will now piece the layers together. Our analysis will be based on each Catchment Area based on 10mins or 15mins walking time.\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins, activate and place the layers in the following order: the MRT stations and lines, walking_roads, TE22A 15mins Buildings, TE22A 15mins Catchment Area, TE22A 15mins Walking Radius, and Open Street Map, as show in the Layers Panel in the image below:\n\nRight click on the Walking radius and click Zoom to Layer. Create a new Print Layout –> Add Map and Legends –> Save as Image.\nIf done correctly, it should look similar to the screenshot below:\n\nRepeat the above steps for each station’s 10mins and 15mins layers as our analysis will be based on each station’s 10mins and 15mins Catchment Areas."

Under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong, our group aims to study the catchment areas of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) Stage 4 MRT Stations.\nThe TEL aims to serve commuters living in the east with a quicker access to the city by placing a station near their homes and workspaces, and to also ease the crowds along the East-West and North-South Lines.\nWith the high construction cost of building a new MRT line, where Singapore’s sixth and longest MRT line cost $25 billion to build, our group aims to assess the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL.\nOverall, we concluded that the opening of the stations in TEL’s stage 4 construction will reduce the travelling time for residents in the Eastern coastal area to the nearest MRT station, while increasing accessibility for tourists who want to visit attraction sites such as the Founders’ Memorial."

    "text": "Overall Analysis\n\nThe map shows the overall Walking Radii and Catchment Areas of all the stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line. The closest MRT Lines that can be seen from the map are the Circle Line's 3 stations: Stadium, Mountbatten, and Dakota. The EWL can be considered close but majority of it are more than 15 minutes of walking distance to the TEL stations. With the implementation of these stations, it will bring about greater accessibility to the areas near the coast which they did not have before.\nFurthermore, each station serves a unique purpose on its own. Even though some of the MRT stations are situated in areas with a high density of condominiums and landed properties, which suggests that these residents are in the middle to high wealth class and have a car of their own, the implementation of the Thomson East-Coast Line will incentivise the residents to use more public transport and reduce carbon emissions towards the environment. In another instance, Marine Parade station increases accessibility for commuters staying far away from a highly inaccessible shopping mall, Parkway Parade. This will in turn generate a greater revenue for shops in the mall. On the other hand, Marine Terrace increases accessibility for students going home or coming to school from 4 schools, which makes it highly valuable.\nIn conclusion, the opening of the stage 4 stations will certainly provide greater accessibility for commuters, bringing residents living in the vicinity to the city much faster than before, while also allowing commuters from other areas to access the amenities in the area at a greater convenience than before. Hence, our group concluded that it is very beneficial to construct the new stations along stage 4 and it outweighs the high cost utilized for its construction."
