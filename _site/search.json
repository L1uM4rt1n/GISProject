    "text": "About our Project\nFrom Coast to City is a project under the SMT201 Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning module in Singapore Management University (SMU). Under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong, our group aims to study the catchment areas of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) Stage 4 MRT Stations.\nThe TEL aims to serve commuters living in the east with a quicker access to the city by placing a station near their homes and workspaces, and to also ease the crowds along the East-West and North-South Lines.\nWith the high construction cost of building a new MRT line, where Singapore's sixth and longest MRT line cost $25 billion to build, our group aims to assess the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL.\nOverall, we concluded that the opening of the stations in TEL's stage 4 construction will reduce the travelling time for residents in the Eastern coastal area to the nearest MRT station, while increasing accessibility for tourists who want to visit attraction sites such as the Founders' Memorial.\n\n\nTeam Introduction\n\n\n\nFig 1.

    "text": "Data Preparation and Cleaning\n\n\nSelection of Required Data\nThe Datasets that are being used for the project includes:\n\nhttps://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-subzone-boundary-no-sea contains the subzone of Singapore where we use it to outline the area of Singapore.\nhttps://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei OSM Data. Data was downloaded as a whole but only the Singapore roads and buildings layer were kept.\nhttps://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/Geospatial/TrainStation.zip Data points of the MRT stations.\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv Using coordinates found from Google Maps, we created a CSV file for the Stage 4 MRT stations with their individual latitude and longitude points.\n\nAdding of Datasets\n\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations\n\nFirst go to ‘Add Layer’, then ‘Add Delimited Text Layer’.\n\nSelect the TE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv CSV file. Under the X and Y field, select Longitude and Latitude respectively. Leave Geometry CRS as WGS 84.\n\nThe following points should appear as below.\n\nSave the layer as GeoPackage and name the layer Stage4_TE_Line, and the CRS as EPSG:3414 – SVY21.\n\n\nMP19 Subzone Layer\n\nAdd in the MP19 Subzone kml layer.\n\n\nOSM layer\n\nAdd the OSM road layer in. Use ‘Select by polygon’ and select the area outlined by the MP19 Subzone layer, leaving out some of the SOuthern Islands, Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong.\n\nExport and Save Selected Features as GeoPackage. Name the layer as all_roads.\n\nRepeat the steps for OSM buildings layer and name it as all_buildings.\nRemove the OSM buildigns and roads layer.\n\nOther MRT lines\n\nAdd the MRTLRTStnPtt.shp file into the layers. There are many different lines but the ones closest to the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line are Circle Line, Downtown Line, and the East-West Line.\nOpen the attribute table of the shape file and click ‘Select by Expression’.\n\nSelect by STN_NO with the letter ‘CC’ in it.\n\nSave the selected features and name the layer Circle Line.\nDo the same for the Downtown and East-West Line, replacing the ‘CC%’ with ‘DT%’ and ‘EW%’ and name the layers Downtown Line and East-West Line respectively.\n\nCleaning Road Data\n\nThere are expressways where the people are not able to walk on. Thus, we have to filter out the following roads with these fclass: motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link.\nSelect all_roads layer and open attribute table, click on select by expression.\nSelect the roads with fclass: ‘motorway’, ‘motorway_link’, ‘trunk’, ‘trunk_link’.\n\nSelect ‘Invert Selection’ to select all the roads without the ones needed to be filtered away. Export and save selected features in GeoPackage and name the layer as walking_roads.\n\nCleaning Buildings Data\n\nThe all_buildings layer consists of several null values under the “type” column. After looking at Google Maps, there consists of different types of low-rise buildings, shophouses, etc. Thus, the team decided to replace the null values for “type” column with low-rise buildings.\nRight-click on all_buildings layer and select Open Attribute Table. Click on Select by Expression. Type in “type” is null in the expression box. Click on Select Features. This will select all building types that have null values.\n\nAfter selecting features, Open field calculator and update the values to ‘low-rise buildings’.\n\nClick on the pencil icon to save the edits.\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Buffers and Iso-Area Polygons\nObjective: Creation of Buffer and Iso-Areas with these data\n\nCreating a 15min Buffer Area\n\nSelect the first station of Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line (Founders’ Memorial).\nGo to Vector –> Select Geoprocessing Tools –> Buffer.\nCheck ‘Selected Features only’\nDistance – 0.75 miles (average walking distance of 15min)\nSegments – 100\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nSave the temporary layer ‘Buffer’ that was generated to GeoPackage, with the layer name as TE22A 15mins Walking Radius.\n\nCreating a 10min Buffer Area\n\nUsing the same steps, the only difference is changing the distance to 0.5miles (average walking distance of 10mins).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nCreating a 15min Iso-Area as Polygon\n\nUsing a plugin, QNEAT3, under Iso-Areas, select Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\nUnder Vector layer, select walking_roads layer.\nUnder Start Points, select Stage4_TE_line, check selected features only Change Unique point ID Field to STN_NAME.\nUnder Size of Iso-Area and Contour Interval, input 900 (15 mins = 900 seconds).\nChange path type to calculate to Fastest Path (time optimisation).\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nSave the polygon layer into the GeoPackage, naming the layer and remove the interpolation layer.\n\nCreating a 10min Iso-Area as Polygon\n\nUsing the same steps, the only changes that needs to be made is:\nUnder Size of Iso-Area and Contour Interval, input 600 (10 mins = 600 seconds).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nCatchment area Buildings – We will be looking at what buildings are there in the catchment area.\n\nFor 15min Catchment Area, select Clip under Geoprocessing Tools.\n\nUnder Input Layer, select all_buildings layer\nUnder Overlay layer, select TE22A 15mins Catchment Area layer\n\nIf done correctly, the following temporary ‘Clipped’ should appear and look like this:\n\nSave the ‘Clipped’ temporary layer as TE22A 15mins Buildings to the GeoPackage.\nFor 10min Catchment Area, repeat the same steps but replacing the Overlay layer with TE22A 10mins Catchment Area, and save to GeoPackage as TE22A 10mins Buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown: (With the 10mins layer active only)\n\n\nRepeat the Steps for Buffer, Iso-Area Polygon and Catchment area buildings for the rest of the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line.\n\n\n\nCreating Symbols and /or Area Colour\n\nFor point Data (Symbols)\n\nWe will need to use symbols to represent the various point layers for easier visualisation.\nFirstly, we will save each station individually into the GeoPackage.\nUsing TE22A station, select the feature and Save Selected Feature as GeoPackage. Name the layer Founders’ Memorial MRT.\nRight Click on Layer –> click on Properties. A pop up ‘Layer Properties’ will appear.\nClick on Symbology –> Simple Marker –> Change the Symbol layer type to SVG Marker –> Search for ‘train’ at the search bar under SVG images –> double-click on the icon\n\nRepeat the steps above for the other Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line stations.\nFor Circle Line, Downtown Line and East-West Line, without the need to save each station individually, repeat the above steps but with the following colours:\nCircle Line – #ffbf00\nDowntown Line – #0009be\nEast-West Line – #00d644\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor Buffer Layer\n\nWe will be using a standardised colour across all 10min and 15min Buffer Layers. In addition, the transparency will be lower for clearer visibility of the catchment area.\nUsing TE22A 15mins Walking Radius, right click on select Properties. Click on Symbology –> Change fill colour to #000080 –> Change Opacity to 30% –> Save Symbol and name it as a Buffer layer –> it should appear in Project Styles for east access.\n******* Blur IMAGE ******\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nRepeat the steps for all 10min and 15min Walking Radius (Use the Saved Symbol in Project styles for easy access).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor Iso-Area Polygon\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins Catchment Area, right click and select Properties –> Click on Symbology –> Change fill colour to #ffdf53 –> Change Opacity to 70% –> Save Symbol and name it as Iso-Area layer –> it should appear in Project Styles for easy access.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nRepeat the steps while using the Iso-Area in Project styles for the rest of the 10mins and 15mins Catchment Area.\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nFor the buildings in Catchment Area\n\nWe will categorise the buildings based on its attribute ‘type’. We will also be standardising each colour for each type based on the following colours:\n\n\n\nBuilding Type\nColour Code\n\n\n\n\napartments\n#477bce\n\n\nchurch\n#e1de21\n\n\ncommercial\n#beb956\n\n\nconstruction\n#45e1c4\n\n\ngarage\n#6c6c6c\n\n\nhouse\n#9cf046\n\n\nkindergarten\n#a27a50\n\n\nlow-rise building\n#0101ff\n\n\nmosque\n#55b987\n\n\npublic\n#42ce81\n\n\nresidential\n#4a2b84\n\n\nroof\n#ea58ca\n\n\nschool\n#ff3355\n\n\ntemple\n#c3154c\n\n\nterrace\n#6c8341\n\n\nretail\n#9200f4\n\n\nhut\n#501dcf\n\n\noffice\n#ff85ed\n\n\nEiS-Residences\n#01f7ff\n\n\nservice\n#d44f3b\n\n\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins Building Layer, Right Click and Select Properties –> Select Symbology –> save the symbols for the type of buildings. Below is an example for apartments:\n\n****** Blur IMAGE ******\nDo the same for the other categories of buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should show in your Project Styles:\n\nWith the saved symbols, now select categorised symbols in the drop-down box at the top –> Under Value, select ‘type’ –> Click Classify –> Change the colours according to the saved symbols –> remove all other values.\n\nRepeat the steps for all the stations’ catchment area buildings.\nIf done correctly, this should show:\n\n\nThickness of roads\n\nFor ease of visibility, we will decrease the walking_roads layer thickness to 0.2mm and change the colour to black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiecing the layers together\n\nAfter we have completed the standardisation and changing of the symbology and colours, we will now piece the layers together. Our analysis will be based on each Catchment Area based on 10mins or 15mins walking time.\n\nUsing TE22A 15mins, activate and place the layers in the following order: the MRT stations and lines, walking_roads, TE22A 15mins Buildings, TE22A 15mins Catchment Area, TE22A 15mins Walking Radius, and Open Street Map, as show in the Layers Panel in the image below:\n\nRight click on the Walking radius and click Zoom to Layer. Create a new Print Layout –> Add Map and Legends –> Save as Image.\nIf done correctly, it should look similar to the screenshot below:\n\nRepeat the above steps for each station’s 10mins and 15mins layers as our analysis will be based on each station’s 10mins and 15mins Catchment Areas."
