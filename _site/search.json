    "text": "About our Project\nFrom Coast to City is a project under the SMT201 Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning module in Singapore Management University (SMU). Under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong, our group aims to study the catchment areas of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) Stage 4 MRT Stations.\nThe TEL aims to serve commuters living in the east with a quicker access to the city by placing a station near their homes and workspaces, and to also ease the crowds along the East-West and North-South Lines.\nWith the high construction cost of building a new MRT line, where Singapore's sixth and longest MRT line cost $25 billion to build, our group aims to assess the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL.\nOverall, we concluded that the opening of the stations in TEL's stage 4 construction will reduce the travelling time for residents in the Eastern coastal area to the nearest MRT station, while increasing accessibility for tourists who want to visit attraction sites such as the Founders' Memorial.\n\n\nTeam Introduction\n\n\n\nFig 1.
