    "text": "About our Project\nFrom Coast to City is a project under the SMT201 Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning module in Singapore Management University (SMU). Under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong, our group aims to study the catchment areas of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) Stage 4 MRT Stations.\nThe TEL aims to serve commuters living in the east with a quicker access to the city by placing a station near their homes and workspaces, and to also ease the crowds along the East-West and North-South Lines.\nWith the high construction cost of building a new MRT line, where Singapore's sixth and longest MRT line cost $25 billion to build, our group aims to assess the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL.\nOverall, we concluded that the opening of the stations in TEL's stage 4 construction will reduce the travelling time for residents in the Eastern coastal area to the nearest MRT station, while increasing accessibility for tourists who want to visit attraction sites such as the Founders' Memorial.\n\n\nTeam Introduction\n\n\n\nFig 1.

    "text": "Data Preparation and Cleaning\n\nSelection of Required Data\nThe Datasets that are being used for the project includes:\n\nhttps://data.gov.sg/dataset/master-plan-2019-subzone-boundary-no-sea contains the subzone of Singapore where we use it to outline the area of Singapore.\nhttps://download.geofabrik.de/asia/malaysia-singapore-brunei.html Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei OSM Data. Data was downloaded as a whole but only the Singapore roads and buildings layer were kept.\nhttps://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/datamall/datasets/Geospatial/TrainStation.zip Data points of the MRT stations.\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv Using coordinates found from Google Maps, we created a CSV file for the Stage 4 MRT stations with their individual latitude and longitude points.\n\nAdding of Datasets\n\nTE Stage 4 MRT Stations\n\nFirst go to 'Add Layer', then 'Add Delimited Text Layer'.\n\nSelect the TE Stage 4 MRT Stations.csv CSV file. Under the X and Y field, select Longitude and Latitude respectively. Leave Geometry CRS as WGS 84.\n\nThe following points should appear as below.\n\nSave the layer as GeoPackage and name the layer Stage4_TE_Line, and the CRS as EPSG:3414 – SVY21.\n\n\nMP19 Subzone Layer\n\nAdd in the MP19 Subzone kml layer.\n\n\nOSM layer\n\nAdd the OSM road layer in. Use ‘Select by polygon’ and select the area outlined by the MP19 Subzone layer, leaving out some of the SOuthern Islands, Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong.\n\nExport and Save Selected Features as GeoPackage. Name the layer as all_roads.\n\nRepeat the steps for OSM buildings layer and name it as all_buildings.\nRemove the OSM buildigns and roads layer.\n\nOther MRT lines\n\nAdd the MRTLRTStnPtt.shp file into the layers. There are many different lines but the ones closest to the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line are Circle Line, Downtown Line, and the East-West Line.\nOpen the attribute table of the shape file and click ‘Select by Expression’.\n\nSelect by STN_NO with the letter ‘CC’ in it.\n\nSave the selected features and name the layer Circle Line.\nDo the same for the Downtown and East-West Line, replacing the ‘CC%’ with ‘DT%’ and ‘EW%’ and name the layers Downtown Line and East-West Line respectively.\n\nCleaning Road Data\n\nThere are expressways where the people are not able to walk on. Thus, we have to filter out the following roads with these fclass: motorway, motorway_link, trunk, trunk_link.\nSelect all_roads layer and open attribute table, click on select by expression.\nSelect the roads with fclass: ‘motorway’, ‘motorway_link’, ‘trunk’, ‘trunk_link’.\n\nSelect ‘Invert Selection’ to select all the roads without the ones needed to be filtered away. Export and save selected features in GeoPackage and name the layer as walking_roads.\n\nCleaning Buildings Data\n\nThe all_buildings layer consists of several null values under the “type” column. After looking at Google Maps, there consists of different types of low-rise buildings, shophouses, etc. Thus, the team decided to replace the null values for “type” column with low-rise buildings.\nRight-click on all_buildings layer and select Open Attribute Table. Click on Select by Expression. Type in “type” is null in the expression box. Click on Select Features. This will select all building types that have null values.\n\nAfter selecting features, Open field calculator and update the values to 'low-rise buildings'.\n\nClick on the pencil icon to save the edits.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Buffers and Iso-Area Polygons\n\nObjective: Creation of Buffer and Iso-Areas with these data\n\n\nCreating a 15min Buffer Area\n\nSelect the first station of Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast Line (Founders’ Memorial).\nGo to Vector -> Select Geoprocessing Tools -> Buffer.\nCheck ‘Selected Features only’\nDistance – 0.75 miles (average walking distance of 15min)\nSegments – 100\n\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\nSave the temporary layer ‘Buffer’ that was generated to GeoPackage, with the layer name as TE22A 15mins Walking Radius.\n\nCreating a 10min Buffer Area\n\nUsing the same steps, the only difference is changing the distance to 0.5miles (average walking distance of 10mins).\nIf done correctly, this should be shown:\n\n\nCreating a 15min Iso-Area as Polygon\n\nUsing a plugin, QNEAT3, under Iso-Areas, select Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\n\n\n\nCreating Symbols and /or Area Colour\n\n\nPiecing the layers together"
