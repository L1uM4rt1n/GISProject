Welcome to G2T4's Project website! Our project is titled: From Coast to City.

### About our Project

From Coast to City is a project under the
SMT201 Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning module in Singapore
Management University (SMU). Under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin Seong, our
group aims to study the catchment areas of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) Stage
4 MRT Stations.

The TEL aims to serve commuters living in the
east with a quicker access to the city by placing a station near their homes
and workspaces, and to also ease the crowds along the East-West and North-South
Lines.

With the high construction cost of building a new
MRT line, where Singapore\'s sixth and longest MRT line cost \$25 billion to
build, our
group aims to assess the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL.

Overall, we concluded that the opening of the
stations in TEL\'s stage 4 construction will reduce the travelling time for residents
in the Eastern coastal area to the nearest MRT station, while increasing accessibility
for tourists who want to visit attraction sites such as the Founders\' Memorial.
