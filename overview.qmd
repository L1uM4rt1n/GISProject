### Project Motivations

There are 5 completed MRT lines in Singapore, most MRT Stations are located near amenities like
shopping malls, and tourist sites, educational institutions, and offices. Travelling
to most places will require a combination of bus and train rides. These MRT stations
are also located near residential areas. With Singapore being an urban city, the
rail network helps to transport an average of 2.1 million passengers daily. However,
there is a small portion of residents who do not live near an MRT station and
could only resort to taking busses or cars. With the plan of the TEL to give
these residents a quicker access to the city.

Despite the benefits to increase accessibility, constructing the TEL comes with high costs.
The Ministry of Transport has a long-term plan to place 80% of residents within
a 10 minutes\' walk from a MRT station,
but will these stage 4 MRT stations be effective in improving the accessibility
of these residents living along East Coast as much as possible?

According to a survey regarding the willingness to walk to the MRT station based on the
distance, about 30% of Singaporeans are willing to walk if the station is 800m
away, dropping to about 10% if it\'s beyond 1km.

With a high proportion of middle to high class people living along East Coast, who owns
car(s) and have access to the current bus and MRT services, are these stage 4
stations still necessary?

### Project Objective

Our team is tasked with studying the catchment area of these MRT Stations by doing a
network analysis of each station and their surrounding vicinity.

By plotting a buffer and a polygon using the QNeat3 Pluggin, our group analysed the effectiveness of the construction of the TEL stage 4 MRT stations based on how convenient did
it bring commuters from that vicinity to town and from elsewhere to that
vicinity.

### Dataset

The data that we collected comes from 4 sources: Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Geofabrik GmbH, and Google Maps.
